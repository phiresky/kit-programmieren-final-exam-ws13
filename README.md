My solution to the final assignments of the "Programmieren" lecture WS13/14 at KIT

* `final1` contains a Connect Four game including an AI. 
* `final2` contains a folder structure optimizer.

The assignment is from http://baldur.iti.uka.de/programmieren-ws1314/index.php?cat=final and also included in this repository.
